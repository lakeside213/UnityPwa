        Welcome to Prey. A lot of this game is going to feel familiar — you’ll
        see bits and pieces from a dozen well-loved games in its DNA. But that
        doesn’t mean you’re going to immediately understand how everything
        works. That’s what we’re here for. Let’s talk about some of the habits

        choices you’re going to be making as you play.

        your enemies (and ways to kill them) and yourself.
